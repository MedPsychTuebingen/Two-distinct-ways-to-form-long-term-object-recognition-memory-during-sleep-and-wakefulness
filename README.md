This repository contains Matlab and R scripts used for the analysis reported in **Two distinct ways to form long-term object-recognition memory during sleep and wakefulness**.
Matlab scripts were used to detect Slow Oscillations and Spindles durin NREM sleep and theta measures during REM sleep. R scripts were used for statistical analyses of the behavior measures and electrophysiological data. 
Raw EEG data and preprocessed data including behavioral measures are uploaded to the Open Science Framework Project (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/4BF2S). https://osf.io/4bf2s/
